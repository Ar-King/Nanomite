###Version 0.1 beta 13
+ fixed some crashs related to the qt /MT build, see note for more details
+ fixed some bugs in the patch manager
+ fixed the symbol display in the trace view
+ fixed a bug which showed wrong trace data

####Notes:
	- Needed to compile Qt with /MD because of issues with the cruntime. If you want to use the
	  debugger you have to install the visual c++ runtime 2010. 
	- You can save an exception to the list in the Options window. The debugger then knows how to handle it.
	  Alternatively you can enable the Exception Assistant. This will show a dialog once a exception occures and
	  offers different ways to handle it.

						have a dependencie of the cruntime even if qtNanomite has been compiled without.
						If you need help to compile your QT this way just drop me an Email / PM.
	- For all:			I will place the needed QT Dlls into the repro and you shouldn´t need the cruntime to be installed anymore.
